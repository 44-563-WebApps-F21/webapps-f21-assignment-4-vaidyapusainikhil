    <h4 class="name">Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house LORD GORING, dressed in the height of fashion, is lounging in an
        armchair_. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN is standing in front of the fireplace.
        He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress.
        As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room</h4>
    <h5 class="name">LORD GORING</h5>
    <p class="speech">Life is never fair, Robert. And perhaps it is a good thing
        for most of us that it is not.</p>

    <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>
    <p class="speech"> Every man of ambition has to fight his century with
        its own weapons. What this century worships is wealth. The God of this
        century is wealth. To succeed one must have wealth. At all costs one
        must have wealth.</p>

    <h5 class="name">LORD GORING</h5>
    <p class="speech"> You underrate yourself, Robert. Believe me, without wealth
        you could have succeeded just as well.</p>

    <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>
    <p class="speech"> When I was old, perhaps. When I had lost my
        passion for power, or could not use it. When I was tired, worn out,
        disappointed. I wanted my success when I was young. Youth is the time
        for success. I couldn’t wait.</p>

    <h5 class="name">LORD GORING</h5>
    <p class="speech"> Well, you certainly have had your success while you are
        still young. No one in our day has had such a brilliant success.
        Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty—that’s good
        enough for any one, I should think.</p>

    <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>
    <p class="speech"> And if it is all taken away from me now? If I lose
        everything over a horrible scandal? If I am hounded from public life?</p>

    <h5 class="name">LORD GORING</h5>
    <p class="speech">Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?</p>

    <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>
    <p class="stage_direction">[_Excitedly_.]</p>
    <p> I did not sell myself for money. I
        bought success at a great price. That is all.</p>

    <h5 class="name">LORD GORING</h5>
    <p class="speech"> 
        <p class="stage_direction">[_Gravely_.]</p> 
        <p class="speech">Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it.
        But what first made you think of doing such a thing?</p>

    <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>
    <p class="speech">Baron Arnheim.</p>

    <h5 class="name">LORD GORING</h5>
    <p> Damned scoundrel!</p>

    <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>
    <p class="speech">No; he was a man of a most subtle and refined
        intellect. A man of culture, charm, and distinction. One of the most
        intellectual men I ever met.</p>

    <h5 class="name">LORD GORING</h5>
    <p class="speech"> Ah! I prefer a gentlemanly fool any day. There is more to
        be said for stupidity than people imagine. Personally I have a great
        admiration for stupidity. It is a sort of fellow-feeling, I suppose.
        But how did he do it? Tell me the whole thing.</p>

    <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>
    <p class="speech"> 
        <p class="stage_direction">[_Throws himself into an armchair by the
        writing-table_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">One night after dinner at Lord Radley’s the Baron began
        talking about success in modern life as something that one could reduce
        to an absolutely definite science. With that wonderfully fascinating
        quiet voice of his he expounded to us the most terrible of all
        philosophies, the philosophy of power, preached to us the most marvellous
        of all gospels, the gospel of gold. I think he saw the effect he had
        produced on me, for some days afterwards he wrote and asked me to come
        and see him. He was living then in Park Lane, in the house Lord Woolcomb
        has now. I remember so well how, with a strange smile on his pale,
        curved lips, he led me through his wonderful picture gallery, showed me
        his tapestries, his enamels, his jewels, his carved ivories, made me
        wonder at the strange loveliness of the luxury in which he lived; and
        then told me that luxury was nothing but a background, a painted scene in
        a play, and that power, power over other men, power over the world, was
        the one thing worth having, the one supreme pleasure worth knowing, the
        one joy one never tired of, and that in our century only the rich
        possessed it.</p>

    <h5 class="name">LORD GORING</h5>
    <p class="speech">
        <p class="stage_direction"> [_With great deliberation_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">A thoroughly shallow creed.</p>

    <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>
    <p class="speech">
        <p class="stage_direction">[_Rising_.]</p>
        <p class="speech"> I didn’t think so then. I don’t think
        so now. Wealth has given me enormous power. It gave me at the very
        outset of my life freedom, and freedom is everything. You have never
        been poor, and never known what ambition is. You cannot understand what
        a wonderful chance the Baron gave me. Such a chance as few men get.</p>

    <h5 class="name">LORD GORING</h5>
    <p class="speech"> Fortunately for them, if one is to judge by results. But
        tell me definitely, how did the Baron finally persuade you to—well, to do
        what you did?</p>
